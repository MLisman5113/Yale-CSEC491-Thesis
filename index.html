    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This thesis explores the persistence of dismissal conflicts in labor markets through a dynamic game-theoretic and computational lens. Despite the theoretical efficiency of mutually beneficial separation mechanisms, real-world employment relationships frequently devolve into adversarial dismissals. Drawing on contract theory, behavioral economics, and recent empirical insights, this study introduces a formal model to examine how strategic hostility, incomplete information, and belief updating jointly sustain inefficient separations over time. The core framework features a firm repeatedly deciding whether to retain or dismiss a worker whose productivity evolves stochastically via a two-state Markov process. A key innovation is the modeling of hostility as an endogenous cost: When severance falls short of the workerâ€™s private cost of dismissal, the firm incurs an additional non-pecuniary penalty. To account for the bounded rationality of firms and the uncertainty about future productivity and conflict risks, the thesis implements a Q-learning algorithm to simulate the evolution of policy under imperfect information. Through comparative analysis with dynamic programming benchmarks, the study shows that firms with limited information often retain unproductive matches longer or adopt firing strategies that underperform socially optimal policies. Hostility significantly reduces firing rates, alters equilibrium behavior, widens the gap between firm profit and social surplus, and benefits the long-term benefits of the worker. Reinforcement learning experiments reveal how updating beliefs about productivity persistence and hostility risk shape the long-term dynamics of separation decisions. This research contributes theoretically by formalizing the interaction between strategic conflict and learning and methodologically by applying reinforcement learning to model labor market behavior. It also offers practical implications for policy design aimed at mitigating adversarial dismissals, reducing informational frictions, and aligning severance structures with perceived separation costs to improve overall labor market efficiency. In general, the thesis deepens our understanding of why adversarial dismissals remain widespread despite the availability of more efficient alternatives.
